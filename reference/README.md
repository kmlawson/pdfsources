# Reference Documentation

This directory contains reference documentation for external tools and libraries that pdfsources integrates with or makes use of.

## Contents

This folder may include:

- Documentation about **anystyle** - the primary citation extraction tool
- Notes on alternative citation extraction tools (e.g., GROBID)
- API references for external dependencies
- Configuration examples and usage patterns
- Comparison studies between different citation extraction approaches
- Technical specifications and format documentation

## Purpose

The reference materials here help developers understand:

- How pdfsources integrates with external tools
- Alternative approaches and tools that were evaluated
- Technical details about citation formats and processing
- Best practices for working with citation extraction tools

This documentation is kept separate from the main project documentation to avoid cluttering the primary development workflow while preserving important technical reference information.
