# Anystyle CLI Tool Evaluation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the evaluation of the `anystyle-cli` tool for extracting bibliographic references from PDF documents. The tool was tested on a small collection of five PDF files obtained from a Zotero library.

## Methodology

The `anystyle find` command was used to extract references from each of the five PDF files. The output of each command was saved as a separate JSON file in the `info` directory.

## Results

The `anystyle-cli` tool was successful in extracting a significant number of references from all five of the tested PDF files. The output is provided in a structured JSON format, which is well-suited for further processing. The tool was able to identify and parse various types of bibliographic entries, including books, articles, and chapters.

## Conclusion

Based on this initial evaluation, the `anystyle-cli` tool appears to be a powerful and effective tool for extracting bibliographic information from PDF documents. It is easy to use and provides a structured output that can be readily used in other applications.

## Next Steps

Further testing could be done on a larger and more diverse collection of PDF files to more thoroughly evaluate the tool's accuracy and performance. Additionally, the `anystyle parse` command could be explored to further process the extracted references.
